# Making Music with Sonic Pi

I have no clue about music, so I'm tracking how I learn to make music, which I often do with Sonic Pi, in this repo.

## Tools

- [Sonic Pi](http://www.sonic-pi.net/)
- [Sonic Pi CLI](https://github.com/Widdershin/sonic-pi-cli) - Ruby based, very simple but effective
- [Sonic Pi Tool](https://github.com/lpil/sonic-pi-tool) - Rust based client with lots of functions
- [Vim Plugin for programming with Sonic Pi](https://github.com/dermusikman/sonicpi.vim)
